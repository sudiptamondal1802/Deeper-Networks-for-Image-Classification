# Deeper-Networks-for-Image-Classification
Image classification is a popular computer vision task improved over the years with the advent of deep neural networks. In this project three popular models are compared: Googlenet, VGG19 and Resnet, for image classification on CIFAR10 and MNIST datasets, without pre-trained weights.The experiments reveal classification of grayscale MNIST images is a simpler task achieving very high accuracy as compared to CIFAR10 RGB images. VGG19 performs best for CIFAR10 with the hyperparameters used in this paper. The baseline models were enhanced for increasing the accuracy of the CIFAR10 image classification.
